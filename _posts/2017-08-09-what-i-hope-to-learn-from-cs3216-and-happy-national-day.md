In setting my learning objectives for CS3216, I looked at it from 1) an individual perspective and 2) a team perspective. Individually, I hope to learn how to learn - programming languages, frameworks, developer tools... Ideally I would also want to identify my own weaknesses and learn from the other passionate and intelligent students in my CS3216 batch. On a team level, I hope for us to learn how to work under pressure of tight deadlines, get used to code reviews and UI/UX reviews, and gain some experience persuading users to come onboard our products!
